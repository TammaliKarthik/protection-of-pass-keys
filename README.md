## Project Description

This project aims to develop a secure file encryption and decryption application using AES-256 encryption. The application ensures that user password keys are securely handled and protected at rest. It encrypts user-selected files using a file encryption key derived from a user-provided password and securely stores the encryption key without exposing it in plaintext.

## Features

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Uses AES-256, a robust and secure encryption standard.
- **Secure Key Derivation**: Employs PBKDF2 with a unique salt to derive keys from user passwords.
- **Password Protection**: Passwords and derived keys are never stored in plaintext.
- **User-Friendly**: Command-line interface for easy encryption and decryption.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed to run on any x86-based Linux system.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Linux operating system (x86-based)
- `cryptography` library

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-file-encryption.git
    cd secure-file-encryption
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Ensure you have the `cryptography` library installed. You can install it via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

## Usage

1. **Encrypt a File:**

    To encrypt a file (`sample.txt`) and save the encrypted output as (`encrypted_sample.txt`):

    ```bash
    python file_encrypt_decrypt.py encrypt sample.txt encrypted_sample.txt
    ```

    - Enter the password when prompted. The encrypted file will be saved in the specified location.

2. **Decrypt a File:**

    To decrypt a file (`encrypted_sample.txt`) and save the decrypted output as (`decrypted_sample.txt`):

    ```bash
    python file_encrypt_decrypt.py decrypt encrypted_sample.txt decrypted_sample.txt
    ```

    - Enter the password when prompted. The decrypted file will be saved in the specified location.

## Files and Directories

- `file_encrypt_decrypt.py`: Main script for file encryption and decryption.
- `README.md`: This README file.
- `sample.txt`: Sample text file for testing encryption and decryption.

## Project Workflow

### Encryption Process

1. **User Input:** Securely prompt user for a password.
2. **Salt Generation:** Generate a unique 16-byte salt.
3. **Key Derivation:** Use PBKDF2 with the password and salt to derive a 32-byte key.
4. **IV Generation:** Generate a 16-byte Initialization Vector (IV).
5. **File Encryption:** Encrypt the file using AES-256 in CFB mode.
6. **Save Encrypted File:** Store the salt, IV, and encrypted content in the output file.

### Decryption Process

1. **User Input:** Prompt user for the decryption password.
2. **Read Encrypted File:** Extract salt, IV, and ciphertext from the encrypted file.
3. **Key Derivation:** Use PBKDF2 with the password and extracted salt to regenerate the key.
4. **File Decryption:** Decrypt the content using AES-256 in CFB mode.
5. **Save Decrypted File:** Write the decrypted content to the output file.

## Justification for Crypto Algorithms

- **AES-256:** Provides robust security and is widely accepted for secure data encryption.
- **PBKDF2:** Ensures that keys derived from passwords are resistant to brute-force attacks by adding computational cost.

## Testing

**Test Plan:**

- **Simple Cases:**
  - Encrypt and decrypt small text files to verify functionality.
  - Compare decrypted output with the original file to ensure correctness.

- **Corner Cases:**
  - Test with files containing non-ASCII characters.
  - Test with very large files to ensure performance and memory management.
  - Attempt decryption with incorrect passwords to confirm that decryption fails securely.

**Run Tests:**

Execute the provided test cases to validate the application's functionality:

```bash
python -m unittest test_file_encrypt_decrypt.py
```
